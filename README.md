# lordle

lordle is an Android focused version of [powerlanguage's](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/) game *[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle)*. Most of the code written by  a brilliant [lynn]() who also goes by [@chordbug]() on Twitter. Check out their repo in the sidebar if you want to really learn how this game works!

## Added Features
* Since this is mostly revolved around being a copy of Wordle that doesn't reuire internet, games are shared by seed instead of by http link. When results are shared they dipaly as such:

```bash
Lordle c2xpbmc 6/6

ðŸŸ©â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›
ðŸŸ©â¬›ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨â¬›
ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©â¬›â¬›
ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©â¬›â¬›
ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©â¬›
ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©
```
&nbsp; So that the seed, and number of attempts are clearly displayed as well as an emoji progress graph, which for some reasons most clones don't 
&nbsp; &nbsp; have!
* You can copy the seed alone at any point in the game by pressing 'Copy current seed to clipboard'.
* You can 'Give up' and see the anser to your prompt, or roll with a new word entirely by clicking 'New word (will clear game)'.
